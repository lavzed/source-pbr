# Preamble
August 2022

This branch of thexas4 serves to add additional features into the PBR shader. This shader is an alternative to BlueFlytrap's mesh-stacking method, which achieves only a pseudo-PBR effect. I added the additional features below to correspond with humans made from Character Creator 3 and up.

### Features (or differences from main branch):
- Two extra bumpmaps
- Facial flexes
- Fixed alpha-test lighting
- Weird rimlight/subsurface-scattering implementation
- Bumptransform for micronormals

These features have rudimentary implementation; they have been made not with optimization 
in mind, rather to enhance my Garry's Mod artistry. I would like your thoughts on how 
you would better implement these changes. Thank you.

### Changed files:
- pbr_ps30.fxc
- pbr_vs30.fxc
- pbr_ps20b.fxc
- pbr_vs20.fxc
- pbr_dx9.cpp

## Installation
If you would like to have PBR in your Garry's Mod, make sure that you are not in the
x86-64 branch. Place the dll from \mp\game\mod_hl2mp\bin\ into the bin folder inside
the "garrysmod" folder (not the folder that contains hlmv or hlfaceposer). If there
isn't a bin folder in the "garrysmod" folder, make one.
Move the vcs files from \mp\game\mod_hl2mp\shaders\fxc into the corresponding
directory in the "garrysmod" folder (garrysmod\shaders\fxc). Again, make a folder if it is not there.

Thanks to thexas4 and his team for introducing (Unreal-like) PBR in Source Engine.
